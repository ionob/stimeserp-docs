# Operation Demobilization

## Overview
The Demobilization module is the final step in the employee demobilization process within your ERP system. Once the Operation Demobilization request has been approved, the final demobilization can be completed in this module. This step ensures that all accommodation and transportation details are finalized, and the employee is officially demobilized from the project site.
