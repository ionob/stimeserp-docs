# Operation Demobilization

## Overview
The Operation Demobilization module is used to manage and confirm demobilization requests that have been initiated at the site level. This ensures that the operation team reviews and approves all demobilization requests before they are finalized, maintaining control and accuracy in the demobilization process.
