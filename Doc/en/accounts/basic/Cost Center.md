# Cost Center

## What is a Cost Center?

In a manpower supply company, a Cost Center is a way to organize and track the expenses related to different projects, teams, or departments. For example, you can create a cost center for each project site or for specific departments like "Recruitment" or "Training." It helps you know where your money is being spent, making it easier to manage costs.

## How to Add or Edit a Cost Center

<div style="text-align:left;">
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Name the Cost Center:</strong> 
        <ol>There’s a field where you can type the name of the cost center. For instance, if you want to track expenses for the "Site A Construction Project," type that into the input box.</ol>
        <ol>This could be for tracking things like salaries, equipment costs, or other resources used at that specific site or for a specific client.</ol>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Save or Cancel:</strong> 
        <ol>Once you’ve entered the name, Save it by clicking the "Save" button to add it to your list.</ol>
        <ol>Cancel if you decide not to add a cost center.</ol>
        </li>

## Example Scenario:

Let’s say your company is supplying workers for two different projects: "Project A" and "Project B". You can create a cost center for each project to keep track of how much each project is costing you, like the salaries of workers sent to these sites or the equipment they’re using.
