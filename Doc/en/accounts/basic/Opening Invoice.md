## What is the Opening Invoice?

## Example Scenario:

<div style="text-align:left;">
    <ul>
        <li>Go to the Opening Invoice section in the Accounts Module.</li>
        <li>Click the New button to open the form.</li>
        <li>Select Supplier as the type.</li>
        <li>In the Party Name dropdown, choose ABC Supplies.</li>
        <li>Enter the invoice details as required.</li>
        <li>Fill in the Invoice No with INV-001.</li>
        <li>Provide a Reference No if needed.</li>
        <li>Choose a Cost Category, such as Supplies.</li>
        <li>Enter the Amount owed, for example, $500.</li>
        <li>Click the Save button to create the invoice.</li>
