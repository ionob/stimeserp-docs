## Example Scenario:

If you want to generate an opening balance for your company, here’s what you would do:

<div style="text-align:left;">
    <ul>
        <li>Navigate to the Opening Balance section in the Accounts Module.</li>
        <li>Review the company name and year (both fields are automatically filled and cannot be changed).</li>
        <li>Click Generate Opening Balance Sheet to see a table of all your accounts, their debit, and credit balances, along with the OPENING BAL ADJ A/C row.</li>
        <li>Click the Reload button if you need to refresh or update the data.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

## How to Generate an Opening Balance

Follow these steps to generate an opening balance for your accounts:

### Step 1: Go to the Opening Balance Section

Navigate to the Accounts Module and find the section called Opening Balance.

### Step 2: Check in the Opening Balance Form

In this form, you’ll see a few fields and buttons:

</div>

<div style="text-align:left;">
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Company Name:</strong> At the top of the form, there is a dropdown showing your company name. This field is disabled, so you can see the name of your company, but you cannot change it.</li>
        <li><strong>Date From and Date To:</strong> The form will show two date fields, Date From and Date To. These fields are automatically set to the current year, starting from January 1st to December 31st. These fields are also disabled, meaning you cannot change the year.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

### Step 3: Generate the Opening Balance Sheet

Once you’ve reviewed the company name and year, click the Generate Opening Balance Sheet button. This will display a table that includes all your accounts, showing the Account Name, Debit, and Credit amounts for the opening balance.

</div>

The table will look like this:

<div style="text-align:left;">
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Account</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Debit</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Credit</strong></li>
    </ul>
</div>

Additionally, the table will include a row labeled OPENING BAL ADJ A/C to adjust any discrepancies between the total debit and credit balances.

### Step 4: Reload the Opening Balance

If you need to refresh the data, you can click the Reload button. This will update the table with the latest information, ensuring that all opening balances are current.

## How Does the Opening Balance Work?

The documents you create are used in different areas, such as:

<div style="text-align:left;">
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Company Name and Year:</strong> The company name and year (January to December) are automatically set and cannot be changed to avoid errors. This ensures that the opening balance is set for the correct company and financial year.</li>
        <li><strong>OPENING BAL ADJ A/C:</strong> This is a special account used to balance any differences between the total debit and credit amounts. It ensures that the opening balance is always accurate.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

## Important Things to Know:

<div style="text-align:left;">
    <ul>
        <li>Date From and Date To fields show the current financial year (from January to December) and are disabled to prevent changes.</li>
        <li>OPENING BAL ADJ A/C: This account helps balance any differences between debit and credit totals automatically.</li>
        <li>Generate Opening Balance Sheet: Always use this button to view the detailed table of accounts and their opening balances.</li>
