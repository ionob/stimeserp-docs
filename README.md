# Documentation Repository README

Welcome to our documentation repository! This README provides instructions on how to contribute to the documentation and organize its structure.

## Getting Started

To add or edit documentation content, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to the `doc/en/` directory:** All English documentation files should be located under this directory.

2. **Edit Existing Documents:**
   - If you need to edit an existing document, locate the relevant Markdown file (`*.md`) under the appropriate section directory.
   - Make your changes directly in the Markdown file using a Markdown editor or any text editor.

3. **Add New Documents:**
   - To add a new document, create a new Markdown file under the appropriate section directory.
   - Ensure the file name is descriptive and follows a consistent naming convention, using PascalCase or separating different names with `-`.

4. **Structure the Document:**
   - Use Markdown syntax to structure the document content, including headings, lists, links, etc.
   - Follow existing document structures and styles for consistency.

5. **Navigation Menu Structure**

Ensure that the navigation menu accurately reflects the document structure for easy navigation within the documentation app.

To update the navigation menu:

- **Navigate to the `docs-nav.json` file:** This file is located in the root directory of the repository.

- **Add or Modify Menu Items:**
   - Use the `items` array in the JSON structure.
   - Each menu item is represented by an object containing `text` and `path` properties.
   - Ensure correct paths to the Markdown files.

6. **Use Visual Studio Code (VS Code) for Editing:**
   - It's recommended to use VS Code for editing Markdown files due to its rich features for Markdown editing.
   - Install the Markdown All in One extension for enhanced Markdown editing capabilities.

## Repository Structure

The repository follows a structured format to organize documentation content effectively. Here's an overview:

- `doc/en/`: Contains all English documentation files.
  - `SectionI/`, `SectionII/`, etc.: Sections of documentation organized by topics.
    - `Document1.md`, `Document2.md`, etc.: Individual Markdown files for documents.
  - `Appendix/`: Appendix section containing supplementary documentation.

## Navigation Menu Structure

The navigation menu (`docs-nav.json`) is structured to reflect the organization of the documentation sections and sub-sections. It consists of an array of items, each representing a menu item with its corresponding text and path.

```json
{
   "items":[
      {
         "text":"SECTION 1",
         "items":[
            {"text":"Document 1","path":"SectionI/Document1.md"},
            {"text":"Document 2","path":"SectionI/Document2.md"}
         ]
      },
      {
         "text":"SECTION 2",
         "items":[
            {"text":"Document 3","path":"SectionII/Document3.md"},
            {"text":"Document 4","path":"SectionII/Document4.md"}
         ]
      },
      {"text":"APPENDIX","path":"Appendix/Appendix.md"}
   ]
}
```
Ensure that the navigation menu accurately reflects the document structure for easy navigation within the documentation app.

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute to the documentation by adding new content, improving existing content, or updating the navigation menu. Follow the guidelines mentioned above for consistency and clarity.
